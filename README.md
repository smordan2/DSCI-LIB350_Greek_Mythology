# DSCI 350M; Humanities Research Data Management; Olivia Ellerbruch, Sadie Mordan and Jacob Waufle, Winter Term 2025
In this class, we'll learn about the theory and practice of how people in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) manage data. We'll look at the different forms this data can take, such as images, video, sound, text, and maps, and examine the processes by which thy are made available to inerested humanities scholars. 
It takes a lot of work to turn a bunch of image files or a pile of documents into something usable, so we'll examine this work from technical, ethical, and social perspectives, and we'll get to do some of it ourselves. As a class, we'll find, organize, and reformat data; learn about and create metadata; evaluate copyright; write a data management plan for a federal gran; and use GitHub to build an open-source website to share humanities data. 

Sadie Mordan created our repository.

 Greek Mythology
 
Our collection focuses on Greek mythology through the ages, highlighting the evolution of select narratives throughout centuries. This collection aims to examine the greater population’s associations with various aspects of this corner of history, and provide context for how such associations came to be. This collection includes primary source artifacts with direct correlation to Greek mythology through symbols and art. This collection entertains questions such as why do we think of Medusa as a villain? Do factors of respective gods, goddesses and gorgon’s identities, such as gender, play into our associations? And if so, why? The data curated in this collection will indirectly offer answers to these questions.

Our audience will be those intrigued by Greek mythology, gender studies, art history, religion and philosophy. This may materialize in fellow digital humanities scholars, or simply a lover of the Percy Jackson series. As such, our audience can use this collection as a foundation for their own research on aforementioned topics, or to provide a nuanced understanding of history.

Our collection includes a variety of art forms sourced from a variety of museums and aggregators: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Public Library and Smithsonian, to name a few. One can find anything from ancient coins and 17th century glass slides to sculptures and 18th century engravings.
