# DSCI 350M; Humanities Research Data Management; Olivia Ellerbruch, Sadie Mordan and Jacob Waufle
In this class, we'll learn about the theory and practice of how people in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) manage data. We'll look at the different forms this data can take, such as images, video, sound, text, and maps, and examine the processes by which thy are made available to inerested humanities scholars. 
It takes a lot of work to turn a bunch of image files or a pile of documents into something usable, so we'll examine this work from technical, ethical, and social perspectives, and we'll get to do some of it ourselves. As a class, we'll find, organize, and reformat data; learn about and create metadata; evaluate copyright; write a data management plan for a federal gran; and use GitHub to build an open-source website to share humanities data.
