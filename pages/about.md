## Description

Our collection focuses on Greek mythology through the ages, highlighting the evolution of select narratives throughout centuries. This collection aims to examine the greater population’s associations with various aspects of this corner of history, and provide context for how such associations came to be. This collection includes primary source artifacts with direct correlation to Greek mythology through symbols and art. This collection entertains questions such as why do we think of Medusa as a villain? Do factors of respective gods, goddesses and gorgon’s identities, such as gender, play into our associations? And if so, why? The data curated in this collection will indirectly offer answers to these questions.  
Our audience will be those intrigued by Greek mythology, gender studies, art history, religion and philosophy. This may materialize in fellow digital humanities scholars, or simply a lover of the Percy Jackson series. As such, our audience can use this collection as a foundation for their own research on aforementioned topics, or to provide a nuanced understanding of history. 
Our collection includes a variety of art forms sourced from a variety of museums and aggregators: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Public Library and Smithsonian, to name a few. One can find anything from ancient coins and 17th century glass slides to sculptures and 18th century engravings.
