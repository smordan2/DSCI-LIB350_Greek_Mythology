# **Data Management Plan**

# Project Description: 

Our collection focuses on Greek mythology through the ages, highlighting the evolution of select narratives throughout centuries. This collection aims to examine the greater population’s associations with various aspects of this corner of history, and provide context for how such associations came to be. This collection includes primary source artifacts with direct correlation to Greek mythology through symbols and art. This collection entertains questions such as why do we think of Medusa as a villain? Do factors of respective gods, goddesses and gorgon’s identities, such as gender, play into our associations? And if so, why? The data curated in this collection will indirectly offer answers to these questions.  

Our audience will be those intrigued by Greek mythology, gender studies, art history, religion and philosophy. This may materialize in fellow digital humanities scholars, or simply a lover of the *Percy Jackson* series. As such, our audience can use this collection as a foundation for their own research on aforementioned topics, or to provide a nuanced understanding of history. 

Our collection includes a variety of art forms sourced from a variety of museums and aggregators: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Public Library and Smithsonian, to name a few. One can find anything from ancient coins and 17th century glass slides to sculptures and 18th century engravings.

# Personnel, Roles & Responsibilities

**Project manager:** Sadie Mordan, responsible for overseeing the progress of the group, creating and updating the shared Google Drive folder and submitting assignments on behalf of the group via Canvas.

**Collection manager:** Jacob Waufle, responsible for customizing the metadata and ensuring the clear displaying of said data on CollectionBuilder.

**Repository manager:** Olivia Ellerbruch, responsible for customizing the GitHub and uploading files to GitHub, as well as uploading files to the Google Drive folder. 

# Expected Data:

We have multiple types of provenance data that is going to be captured exclusively via JPEG or jpg formats. We are going to use Google Drive and Google Sheets to organize our data. We will make a shared folder in our Drives, and a folder within that called “Object\_Folder,” which holds all of our JPEG files. Within the broader shared folder, there is a spreadsheet where we recorded our data as expanded upon in Appendix A. GitHub will be used to create a repository that stores and organizes all metadata in tandem with CollectionBuilder. All changes to the metadata in GitHub will populate in CollectionBuilder — the ultimate display and achievement of this curatorial work.

# Period of Data Retention

We will have this data until graduation when our access to our student emails — and the programs they provide access to — ends. This collection can be downloaded by its hosts and repurposed for personal use as long as the repurposing effort abides by fair use, creative commons copyright laws.

# Data Formats and Dissemination

We are curating a collection that will be displayed on a website maintained by CollectionBuilder. A variety of data in the form of jpegs and jpgs will be shared on this site. The included metadata will be easily exportable with excel and CSV formats from the CollectionBuilder website.

# Data Storage and Preservation of Access

We will create a data repository on GitHub that can be edited by respective personnel, and viewed publicly. We will create a release for this repository on Zenodo to preserve this data on the occasion that Microsoft decides against maintaining GitHub. Furthermore, we will upload the Google Sheets document that serves as the parent document storing this collection’s data to Zenodo. 

**Archival data formats in Zenodo:**

* Push a GitHub release to Zenodo  
* Metadata CSV (export of Google Sheet)  
* ReadME explains the relationship between CSV and archived GitHub site and how to rebuild according to CollectionBuilder documentation  
* Data dictionary (appendix A)

# Appendix A: Data Dictionary

**objectid** \- A unique identifier assigned by the project team to reference the object within CollectionBuilder. 

**filename** \- Name of the file including file type extension within the GitHub repository in the objects folder following the NameofGreekfigure\_Type\_Location naming convention.

**title** \- Name of the object as given by the artist in which the work was made. All objects boasted a title upon creation so there was no need for the project team to provide a name in the absence of one.

**creator** \- The person responsible for the creation, work put into the given object.

**date** \- The approximate time period during which the object was created. 

**description** \- A brief explanation of what the object is, including physical features and other details.

**subject** \- A generalized category that helps to group objects.

**location** \- The city, state or country where the object is located. If information on where the data is being stored is known, the storing location is listed (i.e. the museum).

**latitude** \- A measurement of a location north or south of the equator, used to locate the location of the data on a map.

**longitude** \- A measurement of a location east or west of the prime meridian, used to locate the location of the data on a map.

**source** \- A link to the website where the object is hosted, including museum websites and other links to aggregator websites that include data on the given object.

**identifier** \- Identifiers or object numbers that are given by the website where the object is hosted, although not the same throughout all objects because of differences in websites and museums.

**type** \- The artistic medium in which the object is created/made. 

**format** \- The medium in which the object is accessed or held online, like an image or still.

**language** \- The language involved in the description or the language spoken by the creator of the object.

**rights** \- The specific rights statement given to the object that we are using.

**rights statement** \- A description of the rights of the object, telling how the object may be used and what rights are granted to those looking to use the object.

**medium-** the specific form of the “type”
